Lab 1 Work Plan
By Jonah Spear and David Papp

Breakdown of tasks and estimated durations:
-	Reading through instructions and understanding ALUs and other components involved:
30 minutes
-	Verilog: Constructing ALU, creating testing cases, adding delays, and documenting code:
2 hours
-	Test benches: Creating appropriate and in-depth test cases to test functionality and confirm edge cases work as expected
1 hour
-	Lab report: Write up of our process and learning
30 minutes
-	Miscellaneous problems: This includes mysterious debugging messages, looking for bugs, forgetting to recompile, and more.
1 hour

In total, we expect this to take 4-5 hours. We hope to get started as soon as Thursday, October 5th in order to put as in a good spot, should errors come up.
